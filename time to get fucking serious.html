		<p>So, i made this website because i was bored, and suprisingly enough found it in a reddit post. I wonder how all this long text will turn out. I havent done a text this long yet and im gonna be suprised if its all just one line or if it is like an actually paragraph as i have not even saved it yet at the time of writing this code. Even after i get my result i will prob not change it.
